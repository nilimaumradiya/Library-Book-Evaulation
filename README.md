## Project Objective
In this project, we analyze a dataset that contains information about a library’s book collection. The main aim of this project is to perform descriptive and statistical analysis to gain insights into various aspects of the library’s books. The analysis will help in identifying trends, evaluating book usage, and supporting decisions on resource management, acquisitions, and library services.

##Library Analysis
This dataset helps us understand the library's collection and performance. We will perform various analyses to:
Identify the most popular genres and books.
Assess the overall library rating.
Find books that are most frequently checked out.
Analyze the condition of books and identify the need for replacements or repairs.
Evaluate the average rating for books across different categories.

## Dashboard
An interactive dashboard will be developed to display the findings. The dashboard will include:
-Total number of books in different genres or categories.
-Books with the highest number of checkouts.
-Books with the highest ratings.
-Condition tracking to identify books that need repair or replacement.
-Top authors based on ratings and reviews.
